         * RFC 2396 states:
         * -----
         * Data characters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a
         * reserved purpose are called unreserved.  These include upper
         * and lower case letters, decimal digits, and a limited set of
         * punctuation marks and symbols.
         *
         * unreserved  = alphanum | mark
         *
         * mark        = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"
         *
         * Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing the
         * semantics of the URI, but this should not be done unless the
         * URI is being used in a context that does not allow the
         * unescaped character to appear.
         * -----
         *
         * It appears that both Netscape and Internet Explorer escape
         * all special characters from this list with the exception
         * of "-", "_", ".", "*". While it is not clear why they are
         * escaping the other characters, perhaps it is safest to
         * assume that there might be contexts in which the others
         * are unsafe if not escaped. Therefore, we will use the same
         * list. It is also noteworthy that this is consistent with
         * O'Reilly's "HTML: The Definitive Guide" (page 164).
         *
         * As a last note, Intenet Explorer does not encode the "@"
         * character which is clearly not unreserved according to the
         * RFC. We are being consistent with the RFC in this matter,
         * as is Netscape.
